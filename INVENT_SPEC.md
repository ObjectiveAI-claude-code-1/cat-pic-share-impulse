Rank cat pictures by the strength of the impulse to share they provoke. The core question is: how strongly would this image compel a viewer to send it to someone else or save it for themselves? Evaluate whether the image is self-sufficient enough to be shared with no caption, no context, and no explanation — just the picture alone, sent with the confidence that it will land with the recipient the same way it landed with the sender. Also consider the urge to save: would a viewer bookmark this image or add it to a personal collection, trusting that it will still be good later? Rank highest the images that practically demand to be forwarded or kept — the ones where a person who sees them feels an immediate, almost involuntary urge to make sure others see them too. Rank lowest the images that are pleasant enough in the moment but inspire no action — images that will be scrolled past and never thought of again. The key distinction is between images that provoke active behavior (sharing, saving, returning) and images that provoke only passive consumption (a brief smile, then gone).
