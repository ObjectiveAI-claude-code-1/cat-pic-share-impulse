# Task 1: Evaluate Emotional Immediacy

Look at each cat picture and judge how fast and how hard it hits. The question is not whether the image is pleasant or well-made, but whether it provokes a strong, involuntary reaction — the kind that happens before you have time to think. A picture that makes you laugh out loud, gasp, or say "oh my god" on sight scores high. A picture that earns a mild, considered "that's nice" scores low. The emotion itself can be anything — laughter, tenderness, absurdist delight, bewildered joy — but what matters is the speed of its arrival and the force of its impact. The most immediate images feel like they strike you; the least immediate ones merely present themselves. Rank the cat pictures against one another based on which ones would stop a person mid-scroll with the sheer involuntary strength of the feeling they produce.

# Task 2: Evaluate Self-Sufficiency

Look at each cat picture and judge how well it stands on its own — whether it could be dropped into a message thread with no caption, no context, and no explanation and still land with its full impact. A self-sufficient image does not require the viewer to know the cat, to understand a backstory, to recognize a meme format, or to read any accompanying text. It carries its own meaning inside it. The posture, the expression, the situation — everything the viewer needs is visible in the frame. The image is a complete story in a single moment. It is universally legible: any person, encountering it cold, would get it. Rank the cat pictures against one another based on which ones could travel the farthest from their original context and still work perfectly — which ones are gifts that unwrap themselves.

# Task 3: Evaluate Staying Power

Look at each cat picture and judge whether it would still be just as good the second, fifth, or twentieth time you saw it. Staying power is what separates an image you smile at once and forget from an image you would save to your camera roll and return to months later. The most enduring cat pictures have a quality of inexhaustibility — something in the expression, the absurdity, or the uncanniness that resists being fully processed in a single viewing. Each time you look, there is still something there. They are images that become part of a person's repertoire, kept on hand for the perfect conversational moment. By contrast, images with low staying power are like a joke that is funny exactly once: the initial reaction may be strong, but once you have seen it, the experience has been fully extracted and there is no reason to revisit it. Rank the cat pictures against one another based on which ones a person would choose to keep — which ones would still be worth looking at long after the first encounter.
